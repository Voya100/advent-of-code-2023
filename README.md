This is repository for my solutions for Advent of Code 2023 programming puzzles (https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

Puzzle solutions are implemented with TypeScript/NodeJs (v18.12+). Scripts can be run with `./main.ts X`, where X is in range [1,25].
If using Windows PowerShell, need to use `npx ts-node main.ts`.

Run tests with `npx jest` or `npx jest --watch`. Specific day can be tested with `npx jest dayX`.

Templates for day's scripts and test can be generated with `./createDay.ts X`.
